What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Run git init which creates a .git directory containing files and
subdirectories.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains names of files which will be commited when commit
is next run.
Having a staging area allowd one to review what will be commited before 
actually committing.
